### Learn from Failures

Learning from failures is another key component of developing a growth mindset. This involves seeing failures as opportunities for learning and growth rather than as setbacks. By learning from failures, learners can identify areas for improvement and develop new strategies for success.

### Persist in the Face of Obstacles

Persisting in the face of obstacles is also important for developing a growth mindset. This involves staying committed to your goals even when faced with setbacks or difficulties. By persisting in the face of obstacles, learners can achieve greater success and build resilience.

By cultivating a positive attitude, learners can stay motivated and energized in their quest for knowledge and understanding.

### Seek Out Support

Seeking out support is also important for developing a growth mindset. This involves reaching out to friends, family members, mentors, or colleagues for help and support when needed. By seeking out support, learners can stay motivated and encouraged, even in the face of challenges.
